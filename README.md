- 👋 Hi, I’m @eliwachs
- 👀 I’m interested in identity, privacy, RUST, and web 2.175 (still very early and I think the future) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rust, other rustacian things, and how to build the most scalable APIs in the world
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my company Footprint, and a side project I am doing (NFT airdrop of digital art of ~1920's NYC radiators--very early/nascent space and def the future)
- 📫 How to reach me: eli@onefootprint.com
